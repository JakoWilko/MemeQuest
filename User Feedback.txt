Jack:

More Feedback:
- Foolproof upper and lowercase inputs - Redundant if 1,2,3 choice system is implemented - ADDED
+ Loved the #relatable moments
- Make text all lined up / not all over the place
- Make it so rooms remember choices that happened (gives more weight to choices made) - Will need to have a set
of seperate variables that act as flags and create seperate if statements in the hub subroutine e.g.
- Add pepe ascii at the end - ADDED
